This program created to learn data type in python
"""

# Python use dynamic data types that are dynamic in nature and don't require initialization at the time of declaration
# Some programming language use static data typed that require explicit definition of a data type
# when they create a piece of data (e.g. variable, parameter, return value)
# Example:
# In Java
# int mynumber = 4 //integer data type
# string myname = 'Dudung' //string data type
# float phi = 3.14 //float data type
# In Python
mydata = 4 #integer data type
print(type(mydata))
mydata = 'Dudung' #become string data type
print(type(mydata))
mydata = 3.14 #become float data type
print(type(mydata))

# Now we are focus on data type in python
# Data types in python can be defined into 2 group based on application
# Primitive data types and Non-Primitive data types

# Primitive data type
# Primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed.
# It's used almost in every programming languages.
# include:
# interger, An integer data type represents some range of mathematical integers.
# float, A floating-point number represents a single precision rational number that may have a fractional part.
# boolean,  boolean is typically a logical type that can have either the value "true" or the value "false".
# double, A floating-point number represents a double precision rational number that may have a fractional part.

# Non Primitive data type
